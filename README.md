# Agri-Sahayak: Bridging the Digital Divide with a Voice-First AI Companion

Agri-Sahayak is a hyper-local, multi-modal AI assistant designed to bridge the critical information gap for Indian farmers, empowering them with accessible, proactive, and trustworthy advice.

## 🚀 Key Features in Agri-Sahayak

- **Multi-Modal Access**: A modern React web dashboard for smartphone users and a fully-featured IVR Voice Call system (via Twilio) for any farmer with a basic mobile phone.

- **Multilingual Support**: Fully functional in both English and Hindi, including the voice assistant.
- **Proactive SMS Alerts**: Automatically sends farmers personalized SMS warnings about severe weather or pest outbreaks in their district.
- **Visual Diagnosis**: Allows farmers to upload a photo of a diseased crop to get an instant AI-powered diagnosis.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: With widgets for Weather, Market Prices, and a Crop Activity Calendar.
- **Holistic Knowledge**: Covers both Crop Management and Livestock & Dairy.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Chakra UI, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
- **AI & Data**: LangChain, FAISS, Google Generative AI (LLM & Vision)
- **Platforms & APIs**: Twilio (Voice & SMS), OpenWeatherMap, data.gov.in
- **Database**: SQLite

## ⚙️ Local Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js and npm

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend/agri-sahayak-project

# Install npm dependencies
npm install
```

### 4. Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the project's root directory and add the following keys. You will get these from the respective service dashboards.

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_ai_api_key"
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="your_twilio_account_sid"
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="your_twilio_auth_token"
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER="your_twilio_phone_number"
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="your_openweathermap_api_key"
DATA_GOV_API_KEY="your_data_gov_api_key"
```

### 5. Data Ingestion (You can skip this step as we have already made faiss_indexes per state and saved them in backend/faiss_indexes and then pushed them to github)

**Note**: We have already created and included pre-built FAISS indexes in the `backend/faiss_indexes/` directory for all 4 states (Karnataka, Maharashtra, Punjab, and others). These indexes are ready to use out of the box, so you can skip this step unless you want to create your own custom knowledge base.

**Optional - Only if you want to create custom indexes:**

1. Create an `agri_knowledge_base/` directory in the project root
2. Place your curated PDF documents into state-specific subfolders within the `agri_knowledge_base/` directory:
   ```
   agri_knowledge_base/
   ├── karnataka/
   │   ├── crop_guide_karnataka.pdf
   │   └── livestock_karnataka.pdf
   ├── maharashtra/
   │   ├── farming_practices_mh.pdf
   │   └── weather_guide_mh.pdf
   └── punjab/
       ├── wheat_cultivation_pb.pdf
       └── dairy_management_pb.pdf
   ```
3. Run the ingestion script from the root directory to build the knowledge bases:
   ```bash
   python ingest_agri_data.py
   ```

### 6. Running the Application

**Start the Backend Server** (from the root directory):
```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

**Start the Frontend Server** (from the frontend/agri-sahayak-project directory):
```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
